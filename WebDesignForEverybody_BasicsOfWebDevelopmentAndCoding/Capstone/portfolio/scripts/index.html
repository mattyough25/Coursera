		Hello. My name is Matthew Yough and this is my professional portfolio. You will find my academic and work history over that passed 7 years. You can access all parts of the site by following the navigation bar above. I would love to do business, talk about employment, or share my expertise to anybody who wishes to talk with me. For this reason, I have provided a form where you can fill out your name, email, phone number, and a couple days of the week where you are most free so that I can reach out to you and schedule a meeting. I have also provided my google calendar so you can see which times best suit my schedule. I hope you find this website very helpful and informative!
